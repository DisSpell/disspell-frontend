        "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00:00.000 --\u003e 00:00:04.680\n If you've been learning Rust, you must have heard of Rocket, Rust's most popular web\n\n00:00:04.680 --\u003e 00:00:09.040\n framework. However, if you've looked into this framework, you probably know it has one\n\n00:00:09.040 --\u003e 00:00:14.360\n major issue. There have been numerous reddit posts and online threads pointing out Rocket's\n\n00:00:14.360 --\u003e 00:00:19.800\n incredibly slow pace of development and questioning if Rocket is still the right framework of choice\n\n00:00:19.800 --\u003e 00:00:25.160\n for Rust developers. The good news is, just last week, a brand new major release of Rocket\n\n00:00:25.160 --\u003e 00:00:29.600\n was announced, along with a newly proposed governance model, which I'll go over in this\n\n00:00:29.600 --\u003e 00:00:34.040\n video. At the end, I'll give you my personal view on whether Rust developers should commit\n\n00:00:34.040 --\u003e 00:00:40.680\n to this popular framework or just forget about it. Rocket was created in 2016, just one year\n\n00:00:40.680 --\u003e 00:00:45.680\n after Rust's first stable release, and it rapidly dominated over other web frameworks\n\n00:00:45.680 --\u003e 00:00:51.880\n because of its unique focus on speed, type safety, and its simple API powered by Rust's\n\n00:00:51.880 --\u003e 00:00:57.000\n system. Unfortunately, this success was short-lived and the project took a downhill trajectory\n\n00:00:57.000 --\u003e 00:01:01.640\n for quite a while. Development crawled to a halt with no major version being released\n\n00:01:01.640 --\u003e 00:01:07.840\n in over 4 years. In a GitHub PR comment, the creator and sole maintainer of Rocket, Sergio,\n\n00:01:07.840 --\u003e 00:01:12.240\n mentioned that due to difficulties in his personal life, he didn't have much time to work on\n\n00:01:12.240 --\u003e 00:01:17.880\n the project. However, this situation was not communicated well to the broader Rust community.\n\n00:01:17.880 --\u003e 00:01:22.080\n Many members slowly lost hope in Rocket and started suggesting other frameworks like\n\n00:01:22.080 --\u003e 00:01:26.920\n Actick's web and Axum. And in May of 2023, Rocket was removed from\n\n00:01:26.920 --\u003e 00:01:32.760\n rewebyet.org, a website that points Rust newcomers to recommended libraries and frameworks\n\n00:01:32.760 --\u003e 00:01:38.280\n for web development in Rust. But just when all hope for Rocket's future seemed lost,\n\n00:01:38.280 --\u003e 00:01:42.640\n last week two major announcements were made, a new governance structure for the project\n\n00:01:42.640 --\u003e 00:01:48.640\n moving forward, and the highly anticipated release of Rocket version 0.5. In a blog post\n\n00:01:48.640 --\u003e 00:01:52.840\n titled \"Building a Better Foundation for Rocket's Future,\" Sergio acknowledged that\n\n00:01:52.840 --\u003e 00:01:57.360\n Rocket's recent development has been nothing short of erratic and four years went by without\n\n00:01:57.360 --\u003e 00:02:02.840\n a major release. The community rightfully voiced its disappointment and concern and was generally\n\n00:02:02.840 --\u003e 00:02:08.000\n not happy with Rocket. Sergio went on to take full responsibility, stating that he didn't\n\n00:02:08.000 --\u003e 00:02:12.520\n lead the project adequately, and even though life events pulled him away from the project,\n\n00:02:12.520 --\u003e 00:02:16.920\n he could have done more to communicate that. To make sure this never happens again, Sergio\n\n00:02:16.920 --\u003e 00:02:22.400\n announced plans for a new independent nonprofit foundation designed to support and bolster\n\n00:02:22.400 --\u003e 00:02:27.840\n Rocket's development, increase transparency, and diversify leadership. Going forward,\n\n00:02:27.840 --\u003e 00:02:32.920\n this foundation would be responsible for governing Rocket and dictating its trajectory, the goal\n\n00:02:32.920 --\u003e 00:02:38.040\n being to distribute control and prevent a single person from stalling development. Alongside\n\n00:02:38.040 --\u003e 00:02:43.480\n this announcement, Rocket version 0.5 was released, with some highly anticipated features\n\n00:02:43.480 --\u003e 00:02:48.480\n finally landing. This version introduced two major features, the first being support for\n\n00:02:48.480 --\u003e 00:02:54.720\n stable Rust. Rocket now compiles and builds on stable Rust, which will improve adoption,\n\n00:02:54.720 --\u003e 00:02:59.840\n make maintenance easier, and make builds more reliable. The second major feature is support\n\n00:02:59.840 --\u003e 00:03:05.520\n for Async.io. You can now write Async route handlers, which is a significant improvement,\n\n00:03:05.520 --\u003e 00:03:10.520\n enabling concise, readable, and maintainable asynchronous code, enhancing the framework's\n\n00:03:10.520 --\u003e 00:03:16.320\n performance and scalability for I/O bound tasks, and making it easier to integrate with various\n\n00:03:16.320 --\u003e 00:03:21.440\n libraries and frameworks within the Rust ecosystem. Some of the other features introduced were\n\n00:03:21.440 --\u003e 00:03:27.000\n support for streams, server side events, and web sockets. This news makes me very excited\n\n00:03:27.000 --\u003e 00:03:32.200\n about the future of Rocket. Rocket was the first Rust framework I ever tried, and it made building\n\n00:03:32.200 --\u003e 00:03:36.880\n Rust servers really enjoyable for me. However, at this point, would I generally recommend\n\n00:03:36.880 --\u003e 00:03:41.720\n this framework given its rocky history. If your project is already using Rocket, then\n\n00:03:41.720 --\u003e 00:03:46.220\n I think it makes sense to stick with it. Switching frameworks can be a headache, especially\n\n00:03:46.220 --\u003e 00:03:51.000\n for larger code bases. Luckily, you don't have to. Given the new major release of Rocket\n\n00:03:51.000 --\u003e 00:03:55.360\n and the new governance model, I'm hopeful that the framework has a bright future. On\n\n00:03:55.360 --\u003e 00:04:00.240\n the other hand, if you're starting a new project, then I would personally go with Axum. Axum\n\n00:04:00.240 --\u003e 00:04:05.520\n is built by the Tokyo team, and unsurprisingly has a deep integration with Tokyo. It's also\n\n00:04:05.520 --\u003e 00:04:11.000\n the new Cool Kid web framework for Rust, and is gaining popularity rapidly. Actick's web\n\n00:04:11.000 --\u003e 00:04:15.360\n is another solid choice, especially if you're looking for a framework that's mature and\n\n00:04:15.360 --\u003e 00:04:19.520\n battle tested. And given the recent news, I think Rocket is still a good choice for new\n\n00:04:19.520 --\u003e 00:04:24.280\n projects. I actually use Rocket to implement the web server project in the Rust developer\n\n00:04:24.280 --\u003e 00:04:28.680\n bootcamp. Recently, I've been working on rewriting the project in Axum, but it's good\n\n00:04:28.680 --\u003e 00:04:32.840\n to know that I can keep both versions. If you want to learn how to implement a web server\n\n00:04:32.840 --\u003e 00:04:37.960\n in Rust using Rocket or Axum, head over to let's get rusty dot com slash bootcamp to\n\n00:04:37.960 --\u003e 00:04:41.920\n accelerate your Rust journey.

        "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00:00.000 --\u003e 00:00:06.160\n In this video, I'm going to cover the latest release of Rust, version 1.74.0, which includes\n\n00:00:06.160 --\u003e 00:00:12.400\n three exciting updates, cargo lint configuration, cargo registry authentication, and improved\n\n00:00:12.400 --\u003e 00:00:14.000\n opaque return types.\n\n00:00:14.000 --\u003e 00:00:16.080\n With that said, let's get rusty.\n\n00:00:16.080 --\u003e 00:00:19.920\n The first major update in this release is cargo lint configuration.\n\n00:00:19.920 --\u003e 00:00:24.320\n Previously, if you wanted to configure lints from the Rust compiler or other tools like\n\n00:00:24.320 --\u003e 00:00:28.740\n Clippy, you would either have to set the Rust flag's environmental variable, which would\n\n00:00:28.740 --\u003e 00:00:33.360\n affect the entire build or define crate level attributes in your source code.\n\n00:00:33.360 --\u003e 00:00:38.600\n As of this release, you can now configure crate level attributes in your cargo.toml file.\n\n00:00:38.600 --\u003e 00:00:42.700\n This is nice because you can keep everything in one place and avoid clutter in your source\n\n00:00:42.700 --\u003e 00:00:43.700\n code.\n\n00:00:43.700 --\u003e 00:00:48.560\n Lens can also be configured in a workspace's dot lint's table and inherited by workspace\n\n00:00:48.560 --\u003e 00:00:53.520\n members by setting workspace equal to true underneath the lint configuration.\n\n00:00:53.520 --\u003e 00:00:57.660\n The second major update in this release is cargo registry authentication.\n\n00:00:57.660 --\u003e 00:01:02.220\n When defining third-party dependencies in your project, cargo fetches those dependencies\n\n00:01:02.220 --\u003e 00:01:03.720\n from a registry.\n\n00:01:03.720 --\u003e 00:01:08.840\n A registry is a centralized repository where developers can publish and share their Rust\n\n00:01:08.840 --\u003e 00:01:13.760\n code, and others can easily discover and include these crates in their own projects.\n\n00:01:13.760 --\u003e 00:01:18.560\n The default registry is crates.io, which is a public registry maintained by the Rust\n\n00:01:18.560 --\u003e 00:01:19.560\n community.\n\n00:01:19.560 --\u003e 00:01:24.400\n But you may want to pull dependencies from a custom private repository for various reasons.\n\n00:01:24.400 --\u003e 00:01:29.960\n For example, your company may have internal dependencies or require strict security measures.\n\n00:01:29.960 --\u003e 00:01:35.700\n Fetching dependencies from public registries like crates.io can be done with simple, unauthenticated\n\n00:01:35.700 --\u003e 00:01:36.940\n get requests.\n\n00:01:36.940 --\u003e 00:01:41.780\n But certain actions like publishing a crate require authenticating with the registry.\n\n00:01:41.780 --\u003e 00:01:46.900\n As of this release, you can configure how cargo gets credentials for a registry using\n\n00:01:46.900 --\u003e 00:01:48.780\n credential providers.\n\n00:01:48.780 --\u003e 00:01:53.180\n Built-in providers are included for OS-specific secure secret storage.\n\n00:01:53.180 --\u003e 00:01:56.220\n On Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.\n\n00:01:56.220 --\u003e 00:01:58.860\n Additionally, custom providers can be written.\n\n00:01:58.860 --\u003e 00:02:02.020\n For example, there's a one password credential provider.\n\n00:02:02.020 --\u003e 00:02:06.980\n Using a secure credential provider reduces the risk of registry tokens leaking.\n\n00:02:06.980 --\u003e 00:02:12.660\n As of this release, registries can now optionally require authentication for all operations,\n\n00:02:12.660 --\u003e 00:02:15.700\n such as fetching dependencies, not just publishing.\n\n00:02:15.700 --\u003e 00:02:20.540\n This enables private cargo registries to offer more secure hosting for crates.\n\n00:02:20.540 --\u003e 00:02:25.380\n Note that if you are using a private registry, a credential provider must be configured.\n\n00:02:25.380 --\u003e 00:02:29.420\n The third major update in this release is improved opaque return types.\n\n00:02:29.420 --\u003e 00:02:35.100\n This is a subtle and complex feature, mostly relevant to advanced use cases involving lifetimes\n\n00:02:35.100 --\u003e 00:02:36.620\n and type relations.\n\n00:02:36.620 --\u003e 00:02:41.380\n In this example, we have a wrapper struct containing a reference to a generic type.\n\n00:02:41.380 --\u003e 00:02:46.140\n Then we define an implementation block for wrapper, which has an async function returning\n\n00:02:46.140 --\u003e 00:02:51.500\n self, and a regular function which returns something that implements iterator and yields\n\n00:02:51.500 --\u003e 00:02:53.460\n items of type self.\n\n00:02:53.460 --\u003e 00:02:58.220\n In previous versions of Rust, the compiler did not allow mentioning self in opaque return\n\n00:02:58.220 --\u003e 00:03:03.860\n types like async functions or returned import rates when the type those functions were defined\n\n00:03:03.860 --\u003e 00:03:05.900\n on contained references.\n\n00:03:05.900 --\u003e 00:03:08.740\n You may have encountered error messages like these.\n\n00:03:08.740 --\u003e 00:03:14.220\n Async function return type cannot contain a projection or self that references lifetimes\n\n00:03:14.220 --\u003e 00:03:15.820\n from a parent scope.\n\n00:03:15.820 --\u003e 00:03:20.140\n As of this release, this code simply just works, as you would expect.\n\n00:03:20.140 --\u003e 00:03:25.580\n This restriction is also lifted for associated types mentioned in opaque return types, which\n\n00:03:25.580 --\u003e 00:03:29.860\n previously caused similar errors, but now compile as expected.\n\n00:03:29.860 --\u003e 00:03:33.980\n If you want more information about this release, I'll include the official release blog post\n\n00:03:33.980 --\u003e 00:03:35.440\n in the description.\n\n00:03:35.440 --\u003e 00:03:39.700\n Before you go, make sure to get your free Rust cheat sheet at let's get rusty.com/chee\n\n00:03:39.700 --\u003e 00:03:40.700\n cheat

        "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00:00.000 --\u003e 00:00:05.200\n Hello you absolute legends! Back in July, I confidently announced to the world that the\n\n00:00:05.200 --\u003e 00:00:10.880\n Billy Mitchell vs. Twin Galaxy's trial would begin on October 27th, and by my calculations,\n\n00:00:10.880 --\u003e 00:00:16.320\n we are past that date, so naturally the trial should be well underway. And I've been seeing a\n\n00:00:16.320 --\u003e 00:00:21.520\n lot of comments from people excited for an update, and boy do I have an update for you.\n\n00:00:21.520 --\u003e 00:00:27.200\n The trial is insane. It is complete pandemonium, you will not believe what has happened.\n\n00:00:27.200 --\u003e 00:00:31.840\n If you thought Billy was crazy before, you've seen nothing yet. These are the types of things\n\n00:00:31.840 --\u003e 00:00:37.280\n I would have likely said if the trial had actually begun, but good old Billy has successfully delayed\n\n00:00:37.280 --\u003e 00:00:42.640\n the trial until next January. Though honestly, I would be shocked if it even happened then.\n\n00:00:42.640 --\u003e 00:00:48.640\n Billy is afraid, and his lawyers are really, really afraid. They do not want to go to trial,\n\n00:00:48.640 --\u003e 00:00:53.280\n because they know they will lose, so they are doing everything in their power to prolong the\n\n00:00:53.280 --\u003e 00:00:58.480\n lawsuit for as long as they can. Naturally, if Billy had a case, you'd think they would want to\n\n00:00:58.480 --\u003e 00:01:04.080\n get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I mean, Billy supposedly wants to prove to the world\n\n00:01:04.080 --\u003e 00:01:09.840\n that he didn't cheat, and that Twin Galaxy's were lying. Trial is his opportunity to do this.\n\n00:01:09.840 --\u003e 00:01:15.520\n The entire point of a defamation lawsuit is to show the public that what was said about you was wrong.\n\n00:01:15.520 --\u003e 00:01:20.160\n The entire point is to try and fix your public image and restore your reputation.\n\n00:01:20.160 --\u003e 00:01:25.440\n However, it seems as though Billy isn't really interested in that. All he wants to do is drag\n\n00:01:25.440 --\u003e 00:01:30.640\n things out for as long as possible, and do as much financial damage as he can to his opponents.\n\n00:01:30.640 --\u003e 00:01:34.880\n And he isn't just doing this with Twin Galaxy's, he is doing this with me too.\n\n00:01:34.880 --\u003e 00:01:40.720\n I've been trying to get a trial since June, but Billy keeps running away. He and his lawyers\n\n00:01:40.720 --\u003e 00:01:46.000\n always do something which makes the process take even longer, even though I've been ready to go\n\n00:01:46.000 --\u003e 00:01:51.760\n for months. On top of this, somehow I have become a central figure in the Twin Galaxy's lawsuit.\n\n00:01:51.760 --\u003e 00:01:57.120\n Billy's lawyers are making up insane lies about me and creating crazy conspiracy theories.\n\n00:01:57.120 --\u003e 00:02:01.280\n I honestly don't know if it's because they are legitimately dumb or because they are legitimately\n\n00:02:01.280 --\u003e 00:02:06.480\n scummy people. But whatever the case, whenever they bring up me in the legal filings, it seems\n\n00:02:06.480 --\u003e 00:02:11.440\n like there are a few drops to about 60. Billy's lawyers are so afraid they are even trying to\n\n00:02:11.440 --\u003e 00:02:16.480\n get the lawyer for Twin Galaxy's removed from the lawsuit. The only reason they would do this\n\n00:02:16.480 --\u003e 00:02:20.960\n is if they think it's beneficial to their case. If you think Billy's lawyers are just doing their\n\n00:02:20.960 --\u003e 00:02:26.800\n job, think again. These people are liars and scumbags. And I know this because they are lying\n\n00:02:26.800 --\u003e 00:02:32.000\n about me, and I know the truth.

There are a ton of steps involved, and lawyers have a habit of\n\n00:03:48.880 --\u003e 00:03:54.960\n waiting until the last minute to do things. But still, they can't last forever. They have to end\n\n00:03:54.960 --\u003e 00:04:00.240\n eventually. And normally, if you are the innocent party, you want it to end as soon as possible,\n\n00:04:00.240 --\u003e 00:04:06.000\n which in this case happens to be me. I want to go to trial, and I'm ready for trial. The only reason\n\n00:04:06.000 --\u003e 00:04:11.760\n I haven't had trial yet is because of Billy Mitchell. Back in June, I officially requested a trial date,\n\n00:04:11.760 --\u003e 00:04:17.680\n and then two weeks later, suddenly his lawyer retires, and he has to find new representation.\n\n00:04:17.680 --\u003e 00:04:22.080\n I mean, what are the odds that Billy's lawyer retired immediately after we asked to go to trial?\n\n00:04:22.080 --\u003e 00:04:26.000\n Surely he would have known earlier and was planning for it, but if that was the case,\n\n00:04:26.000 --\u003e 00:04:31.520\n why was he still representing Billy? Why did Billy get dropped? Literally, the moment the prospect of\n\n00:04:31.520 --\u003e 00:04:37.440\n trial was brought up. In any case, Billy found new lawyers, but of course, they wanted to delay\n\n00:04:37.440 --\u003e 00:04:43.200\n things so they had more time to prepare. I don't blame them, because Billy's original lawyer was\n\n00:04:43.200 --\u003e 00:04:48.800\n terrible. Absolutely terrible. I think Billy was trying to do things as cheaply as possible,\n\n00:04:48.800 --\u003e 00:04:54.240\n because the original complaint that was submitted is just astonishingly bad. The new lawyers probably\n\n00:04:54.240 --\u003e 00:04:59.520\n know it's bad, and they started to make changes. But the problem is that you can't just start making\n\n00:04:59.520 --\u003e 00:05:05.520\n changes to a complaint that is years old. It's completely unreasonable, and in many cases, against\n\n00:05:05.520 --\u003e 00:05:10.080\n the rules. So now we have to go through this battle to try and stop all these changes being made,\n\n00:05:10.080 --\u003e 00:05:15.840\n and it is again dragging things out. Thankfully, if Billy does amend his original complaint and I\n\n00:05:15.840 --\u003e 00:05:20.720\n have to draft a new defense, it looks like Billy will have to cover my costs in doing so.\n\n00:05:20.720 --\u003e 00:05:25.440\n So if he does keep amending his complaint, he'll be paying legal fees on both sides\n\n00:05:25.440 --\u003e 00:05:30.160\n until it's all resolved. Australia is really good when it comes to compensating costs.\n\n00:05:30.160 --\u003e 00:05:34.560\n If he changes something two years later, and then I have to spend more because of it,\n\n00:05:34.560 --\u003e 00:05:39.200\n the Australian court say that Billy needs to compensate me back for the extra effort.\n\n00:05:39.200 --\u003e 00:05:44.080\n So if Billy does keep messing around, delaying things, he will have to pay a lot of money.\n\n00:05:44.080 --\u003e 00:05:48.400\n But unfortunately for me, it just means I have to keep dealing with this for a lot longer.\n\n00:05:48.400 --\u003e 00:05:51.440\n But for my part, I am definitely ready to rock.\n\n00:05:51.440 --\u003e 00:05:59.120\n Originally the Twin Galaxies lawsuit was set for October, but again, Billy is running and hiding.\n\n00:05:59.120 --\u003e 00:06:05.200\n His lawyers successfully delayed it until November, and then they delayed it again until January.\n\n00:06:05.200 --\u003e 00:06:10.000\n Twin Galaxies wants to go to trial as soon as possible. Who wouldn't want to go to trial\n\n00:06:10.000 --\u003e 00:06:15.760\n against Billy Mitchell? It's the easiest slam dunk of all time. The man is a walking L.\n\n00:06:15.760 --\u003e 00:06:21.040\n Billy has no case, he has no evidence, and he has no witnesses. And funnily enough,\n\n00:06:21.040 --\u003e 00:06:26.080\n Billy's lawyers are blaming me for Billy having no one that's willing to lie on his behalf.\n\n00:06:26.080 --\u003e 00:06:30.640\n Yes, it's my fault that Billy can't get any witnesses to back up his story.\n\n00:06:30.640 --\u003e 00:06:35.840\n Recently, Billy's lawyers filed a motion to disqualify Tash, the lawyer for Twin Galaxies,\n\n00:06:35.840 --\u003e 00:06:41.360\n from the lawsuit. And one of the reasons is because Tash gave me access to depositions.\n\n00:06:41.360 --\u003e 00:06:46.400\n Billy claims his deposition was confidential, and his lawyers have already tried to argue this\n\n00:06:46.400 --\u003e 00:06:51.680\n in a previous motion. Previously they tried to hold Tash in contempt for providing depositions,\n\n00:06:51.680 --\u003e 00:06:56.400\n and the judge denied the order. Now they are doing the same thing again,\n\n00:06:56.400 --\u003e 00:07:00.080\n even though the judge has already ruled on this exact matter.\n\n00:07:00.080 --\u003e 00:07:04.080\n First of all, nothing marked confidential was sent to me, and second of all,\n\n00:07:04.080 --\u003e 00:07:09.600\n most of the materials I get don't even come from Tash, it comes from Twin Galaxies.\n\n00:07:09.600 --\u003e 00:07:14.400\n In Billy's recent motion, they claim that Tash sent me depositions for all of these people.\n\n00:07:14.400 --\u003e 00:07:19.200\n However, they are just making things up. Yes, Tash did send me a couple of depositions,\n\n00:07:19.200 --\u003e 00:07:24.080\n but most of the ones I've received didn't come from him. And yet, Billy's lawyers are happy to\n\n00:07:24.080 --\u003e 00:07:29.680\n make up lies with no evidence to try and get Tash disqualified. He claims that Tash continued\n\n00:07:29.680 --\u003e 00:07:34.400\n to send me depositions after he was informed it was a violation of the protective order,\n\n00:07:34.400 --\u003e 00:07:39.600\n but this is patently false. First, the deposition was not confidential, and again,\n\n00:07:39.600 --\u003e 00:07:45.360\n the judge has already ruled on that. And second, Tony's email to Tash was on July 14.\n\n00:07:45.360 --\u003e 00:07:51.520\n The last email me or my lawyers ever received from Tash was July 6, a week earlier. Everything\n\n00:07:51.520 --\u003e 00:07:56.720\n else I've ever gotten came from Twin Galaxies, not their lawyer. They claim that because I talk\n\n00:07:56.720 --\u003e 00:08:02.160\n about depositions in my videos, Billy can't get his friends to sit for deposition. They cite Billy's\n\n00:08:02.160 --\u003e 00:08:07.680\n friend Robert Childs, saying that he is afraid. But here's the thing about Rob Childs. Rob was\n\n00:08:07.680 --\u003e 00:08:13.440\n supposed to be deposed in January at the same time as Billy Mitchell, but just before his deposition,\n\n00:08:13.440 --\u003e 00:08:18.720\n he got a lawyer and avoided it, and has been trying desperately to avoid being asked questions.\n\n00:08:18.720 --\u003e 00:08:24.800\n So he was already unwilling to testify for Billy in January, which is half a year before I made\n\n00:08:24.800 --\u003e 00:08:30.720\n any videos about any depositions. Again, it's just another lie. They also claim that Triforce\n\n00:08:30.720 --\u003e 00:08:36.080\n won't sit for deposition for the same reason. They want us to believe that Triforce, the guy that\n\n00:08:36.080 --\u003e 00:08:41.360\n does public talks defending Billy, the guy that uploads YouTube videos to his own channel\n\n00:08:41.360 --\u003e 00:08:47.040\n defending Billy Mitchell, is afraid to defend Billy in a deposition because it will be uploaded\n\n00:08:47.040 --\u003e 00:08:52.960\n to the internet. This is what I mean when I say Billy's lawyers have an IQ of 60. They cannot grasp\n\n00:08:52.960 --\u003e 00:08:58.960\n simple logic. Obviously, Triforce doesn't care if something is posted online, he does it himself.\n\n00:08:58.960 --\u003e 00:09:04.000\n On Twitter, he even acted as if deposing him wouldn't be a problem. It's only when Billy\n\n00:09:04.000 --\u003e 00:09:10.320\n wants to try to attack twin galaxies that Triforce is now suddenly camera shy. Of course, all of\n\n00:09:10.320 --\u003e 00:09:16.080\n this is irrelevant, however, because all Billy has to do is subpoena Rob Childs or Triforce,\n\n00:09:16.080 --\u003e 00:09:21.760\n and they don't have a choice but to sit down for a deposition. But Billy won't subpoena them,\n\n00:09:21.760 --\u003e 00:09:25.680\n because he knows they won't be able to keep all of their lies straight.\n\n00:09:25.680 --\u003e 00:09:30.720\n Keep in mind, twin galaxies have always been very open about any information they have.\n\n00:09:30.720 --\u003e 00:09:35.840\n They want the public to know as much as possible. Twin galaxies cares about the truth and wants\n\n00:09:35.840 --\u003e 00:09:41.600\n the truth to be known, whatever that truth may be. So, twin galaxies provide any information that\n\n00:09:41.600 --\u003e 00:09:48.000\n it can, and twin galaxies has had no problem getting witnesses to testify, because as it turns out,\n\n00:09:48.000 --\u003e 00:09:53.200\n people are happy to tell their story when they aren't lying. It's only when people have to lie\n\n00:09:53.200 --\u003e 00:09:57.760\n that answering questions becomes difficult. Billy Mitchell is the one that's trying to keep\n\n00:09:57.760 --\u003e 00:10:03.680\n all of this information suppressed. It's Billy Mitchell that is afraid of the truth coming out.\n\n00:10:03.680 --\u003e 00:10:08.000\n Billy's lawyers also lie about communications I've had with twin galaxies.\n\n00:10:08.000 --\u003e 00:10:12.640\n Billy was very upset about getting caught in the lie about the color of the joystick\n\n00:10:12.640 --\u003e 00:10:17.040\n at the mortgage broker's convention. They claim that twin galaxies should have given them the\n\n00:10:17.040 --\u003e 00:10:22.960\n photos beforehand, and that tricking Billy was morally wrong. They take a portion of my video\n\n00:10:22.960 --\u003e 00:10:28.000\n and try to use it as proof that it was all an evil scheme. There are so many logical\n\n00:10:28.000 --\u003e 00:10:32.400\n flaws in here, it's honestly hard to believe, so I'll just wrap it fire through the problems,\n\n00:10:32.400 --\u003e 00:10:37.280\n or we will be here all day. If you need to, you can pause my video to read my script first.\n\n00:10:37.280 --\u003e 00:10:42.080\n They say twin galaxies only sent them two emails from me during discovery,\n\n00:10:42.080 --\u003e 00:10:47.920\n but that's impossible because I knew about the photos. Therefore, this must be a giant cover-up.\n\n00:10:47.920 --\u003e 00:10:53.440\n Oh my god, a six-year-old could debunk this logic. I communicate with Jayce Hall through\n\n00:10:53.440 --\u003e 00:10:59.280\n Signal, which deletes messages after 10 minutes. They seem to forget that email isn't the only\n\n00:10:59.280 --\u003e 00:11:04.240\n form of communication. They quote me as saying I knew about the photos for years, which I have\n\n00:11:04.240 --\u003e 00:11:10.240\n just never said. What are they even quoting? Those two words don't appear in the quoted paragraph,\n\n00:11:10.240 --\u003e 00:11:16.640\n and I've never even said that. I just said I knew the photos existed. I never gave a time frame.\n\n00:11:16.640 --\u003e 00:11:21.440\n They think that because I knew twin galaxies had the photos since 2020, that means twin\n\n00:11:21.440 --\u003e 00:11:28.560\n galaxies must have told me in 2020. This is insanely stupid. Twin galaxies told me,\n\n00:11:28.560 --\u003e 00:11:34.400\n years later, they had the photos since 2020. Billy's lawyers haven't yet discovered the concept\n\n00:11:34.400 --\u003e 00:11:39.840\n of talking about past events. I knew about the photos beforehand, but that doesn't mean I knew\n\n00:11:39.840 --\u003e 00:11:46.320\n because of twin galaxies either. Those photos have been in the public domain since 2011.\n\n00:11:46.320 --\u003e 00:11:52.240\n Multiple people outside of twin galaxies independently had seen the photos, but truthfully,\n\n00:11:52.240 --\u003e 00:11:58.320\n I saw the photos for the first time after Billy's deposition. Before that, I only knew that photos\n\n00:11:58.320 --\u003e 00:12:04.640\n showing a red joystick existed. I hadn't seen them myself, which is why in my video, I say I knew\n\n00:12:04.640 --\u003e 00:12:10.000\n about them, not that I had them or had seen them. They say that I said twin galaxies planned to\n\n00:12:10.000 --\u003e 00:12:14.880\n withhold the photos so they could lay a trap. And apparently, I can only know this because twin\n\n00:12:14.880 --\u003e 00:12:20.800\n galaxies told me. But twin galaxies didn't tell me that, it's just obvious from the deposition.\n\n00:12:20.800 --\u003e 00:12:26.000\n Anyone with more than two brain cells who watches that deposition knows the questions they asked,\n\n00:12:26.000 --\u003e 00:12:32.240\n only makes sense if they assumed Billy didn't have the photos. Obviously, twin galaxies didn't\n\n00:12:32.240 --\u003e 00:12:37.120\n give Billy the photos. When I made my YouTube video, I was just typing it up to make it more\n\n00:12:37.120 --\u003e 00:12:43.520\n interesting. And besides, this trap only works if Billy is a compulsive liar, which he just happens\n\n00:12:43.520 --\u003e 00:12:49.440\n to be. Tony Elrod claims he asked for the photos as part of Discovery and refers to requests for\n\n00:12:49.440 --\u003e 00:12:55.280\n production 36. This was asking for any documents supporting allegations made by twin galaxies in\n\n00:12:55.280 --\u003e 00:13:01.840\n paragraph 25 of the cross complaint. That paragraph talks about a live performance on July 14.\n\n00:13:01.840 --\u003e 00:13:07.920\n However, the photos were actually taken on July 13. So they aren't even on the same day,\n\n00:13:07.920 --\u003e 00:13:13.600\n therefore they are not evidence Billy even played on July 14. And couldn't support that claim in\n\n00:13:13.600 --\u003e 00:13:19.760\n any way. All those photos show is Billy standing in front of a Donkey Kong machine the day prior.\n\n00:13:19.760 --\u003e 00:13:24.000\n They don't confirm he played it, they don't even confirm that it was the machining question.\n\n00:13:24.000 --\u003e 00:13:29.840\n It is impossible to determine if that machine relates to his July 14 score. In his lawsuit,\n\n00:13:29.840 --\u003e 00:13:35.360\n Billy claims he played on an unmodified machine. So based on what Billy had previously said,\n\n00:13:35.360 --\u003e 00:13:40.160\n as far as twin galaxies knew, that machine couldn't have been the one he played on,\n\n00:13:40.160 --\u003e 00:13:45.760\n because that machine was modified. It wasn't until Billy confirmed himself that it was the machine\n\n00:13:45.760 --\u003e 00:13:51.120\n he used that the photos became relevant. But do you want to know what the best part of the\n\n00:13:51.120 --\u003e 00:13:58.480\n red joystick saga is? Billy did actually know the photos existed, and he even already had them\n\n00:13:58.480 --\u003e 00:14:04.800\n himself. Now I know what you're thinking. How the fuck is it possible that Billy had the photos\n\n00:14:04.800 --\u003e 00:14:09.760\n and still lied about the color of the stick and fell for the trap? Well my friend,\n\n00:14:09.760 --\u003e 00:14:14.240\n there are just some things us mortal men can simply never grasp or comprehend.\n\n00:14:14.240 --\u003e 00:14:21.200\n All we can try to do is know the facts. In 2018, Billy called David race and said the convention had\n\n00:14:21.200 --\u003e 00:14:50.560\n photos. Here's a clip from that phone call. Then in August,\n\n00:14:50.560 --\u003e 00:14:57.120\n 2022, five months before his deposition, Billy subpoenaed the convention and got the photos. So\n\n00:14:57.120 --\u003e 00:15:02.960\n Billy already had them. And still in his deposition, not only did he say he didn't have photos.\n\n00:15:15.520 --\u003e 00:15:34.880\n But he still said the stick was black. There are multiple levels of stupidity running\n\n00:15:34.880 --\u003e 00:15:40.640\n concurrently here. And you know what's interesting? When Tash asked Billy if he had photos and Billy\n\n00:15:40.640 --\u003e 00:15:46.720\n said no, who was sitting right next to Billy? Billy's lawyer, Tony Elrod. So Tony was happy to\n\n00:15:46.720 --\u003e 00:15:51.360\n sit there and listen to his client lie and was happy to keep the fact that he had the photos a\n\n00:15:51.360 --\u003e 00:15:57.600\n secret, but when Twin Galaxes traps a compulsive liar, now that becomes a problem. Tony Elrod\n\n00:15:57.600 --\u003e 00:16:02.640\n complains about Tash for various things, like messaging Billy's witnesses trying to get them to\n\n00:16:02.640 --\u003e 00:16:09.360\n send evidence or testify, or showing emotion in his email correspondence. But he himself has done\n\n00:16:09.360 --\u003e 00:16:15.360\n far worse. Tony lied directly to a witness about what Billy Mitchell had said in his deposition,\n\n00:16:15.360 --\u003e 00:16:19.840\n in order to try and coerce the witness into changing their testimony, because what the\n\n00:16:19.840 --\u003e 00:16:25.440\n witness was saying was so damaging to Billy's case. Elrod is happy to send over fabricated\n\n00:16:25.440 --\u003e 00:16:31.360\n evidence and lie on behalf of his client, and when exposed, simply say that it's all a conspiracy\n\n00:16:31.360 --\u003e 00:16:36.720\n theory. Billy's lawyers are going after Tash because Tash is good, and they know they will be\n\n00:16:36.720 --\u003e 00:16:42.320\n destroyed at trial. Billy and his lawyer Tony Elrod are cowards doing everything they can,\n\n00:16:42.320 --\u003e 00:16:47.440\n trying to prevent this entire pathetic lawsuit from being shown to a jury. Everyone knows they\n\n00:16:47.440 --\u003e 00:16:53.600\n will lose, including them, and they are desperate. And I really hope Tony Elrod improves his\n\n00:16:53.600 --\u003e 00:16:58.800\n comprehension skills and gets his facts straight before talking about me again in his frivolous\n\n00:16:58.800 --\u003e 00:17:03.440\n lawsuit. I will let you know when any further updates happen. Thank you so much for watching\n\n00:17:03.440 --\u003e 00:17:11.040\n you legends. I hope you're having a fantastic day, and I will see you in the next video.\n\n",

        "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00:00.000 --\u003e 00:00:05.200\n Hello you absolute legends! Back in July, I confidently announced to the world that the\n\n00:00:05.200 --\u003e 00:00:10.880\n Billy Mitchell vs. Twin Galaxy's trial would begin on October 27th, and by my calculations,\n\n00:00:10.880 --\u003e 00:00:16.320\n we are past that date, so naturally the trial should be well underway. And I've been seeing a\n\n00:00:16.320 --\u003e 00:00:21.520\n lot of comments from people excited for an update, and boy do I have an update for you.\n\n00:00:21.520 --\u003e 00:00:27.200\n The trial is insane. It is complete pandemonium, you will not believe what has happened.\n\n00:00:27.200 --\u003e 00:00:31.840\n If you thought Billy was crazy before, you've seen nothing yet. These are the types of things\n\n00:00:31.840 --\u003e 00:00:37.280\n I would have likely said if the trial had actually begun, but good old Billy has successfully delayed\n\n00:00:37.280 --\u003e 00:00:42.640\n the trial until next January. Though honestly, I would be shocked if it even happened then.\n\n00:00:42.640 --\u003e 00:00:48.640\n Billy is afraid, and his lawyers are really, really afraid. They do not want to go to trial,\n\n00:00:48.640 --\u003e 00:00:53.280\n because they know they will lose, so they are doing everything in their power to prolong the\n\n00:00:53.280 --\u003e 00:00:58.480\n lawsuit for as long as they can. Naturally, if Billy had a case, you'd think they would want to\n\n00:00:58.480 --\u003e 00:01:04.080\n get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I mean, Billy supposedly wants to prove to the world\n\n00:01:04.080 --\u003e 00:01:09.840\n that he didn't cheat, and that Twin Galaxy's were lying. Trial is his opportunity to do this.\n\n00:01:09.840 --\u003e 00:01:15.520\n The entire point of a defamation lawsuit is to show the public that what was said about you was wrong.\n\n00:01:15.520 --\u003e 00:01:20.160\n The entire point is to try and fix your public image and restore your reputation.\n\n00:01:20.160 --\u003e 00:01:25.440\n However, it seems as though Billy isn't really interested in that. All he wants to do is drag\n\n00:01:25.440 --\u003e 00:01:30.640\n things out for as long as possible, and do as much financial damage as he can to his opponents.\n\n00:01:30.640 --\u003e 00:01:34.880\n And he isn't just doing this with Twin Galaxy's, he is doing this with me too.\n\n00:01:34.880 --\u003e 00:01:40.720\n I've been trying to get a trial since June, but Billy keeps running away. He and his lawyers\n\n00:01:40.720 --\u003e 00:01:46.000\n always do something which makes the process take even longer, even though I've been ready to go\n\n00:01:46.000 --\u003e 00:01:51.760\n for months. On top of this, somehow I have become a central figure in the Twin Galaxy's lawsuit.\n\n00:01:51.760 --\u003e 00:01:57.120\n Billy's lawyers are making up insane lies about me and creating crazy conspiracy theories.\n\n00:01:57.120 --\u003e 00:02:01.280\n I honestly don't know if it's because they are legitimately dumb or because they are legitimately\n\n00:02:01.280 --\u003e 00:02:06.480\n scummy people. But whatever the case, whenever they bring up me in the legal filings, it seems\n\n00:02:06.480 --\u003e 00:02:11.440\n like there are a few drops to about 60. Billy's lawyers are so afraid they are even trying to\n\n00:02:11.440 --\u003e 00:02:16.480\n get the lawyer for Twin Galaxy's removed from the lawsuit. The only reason they would do this\n\n00:02:16.480 --\u003e 00:02:20.960\n is if they think it's beneficial to their case. If you think Billy's lawyers are just doing their\n\n00:02:20.960 --\u003e 00:02:26.800\n job, think again. These people are liars and scumbags. And I know this because they are lying\n\n00:02:26.800 --\u003e 00:02:32.000\n about me, and I know the truth. In this video, I will give you a quick update as to what's been\n\n00:02:32.000 --\u003e 00:02:38.080\n happening. I really hope you enjoy.

There are a ton of steps involved, and lawyers have a habit of\n\n00:03:48.880 --\u003e 00:03:54.960\n waiting until the last minute to do things. But still, they can't last forever. They have to end\n\n00:03:54.960 --\u003e 00:04:00.240\n eventually. And normally, if you are the innocent party, you want it to end as soon as possible,\n\n00:04:00.240 --\u003e 00:04:06.000\n which in this case happens to be me. I want to go to trial, and I'm ready for trial. The only reason\n\n00:04:06.000 --\u003e 00:04:11.760\n I haven't had trial yet is because of Billy Mitchell. Back in June, I officially requested a trial date,\n\n00:04:11.760 --\u003e 00:04:17.680\n and then two weeks later, suddenly his lawyer retires, and he has to find new representation.\n\n00:04:17.680 --\u003e 00:04:22.080\n I mean, what are the odds that Billy's lawyer retired immediately after we asked to go to trial?\n\n00:04:22.080 --\u003e 00:04:26.000\n Surely he would have known earlier and was planning for it, but if that was the case,\n\n00:04:26.000 --\u003e 00:04:31.520\n why was he still representing Billy? Why did Billy get dropped? Literally, the moment the prospect of\n\n00:04:31.520 --\u003e 00:04:37.440\n trial was brought up. In any case, Billy found new lawyers, but of course, they wanted to delay\n\n00:04:37.440 --\u003e 00:04:43.200\n things so they had more time to prepare. I don't blame them, because Billy's original lawyer was\n\n00:04:43.200 --\u003e 00:04:48.800\n terrible. Absolutely terrible. I think Billy was trying to do things as cheaply as possible,\n\n00:04:48.800 --\u003e 00:04:54.240\n because the original complaint that was submitted is just astonishingly bad. The new lawyers probably\n\n00:04:54.240 --\u003e 00:04:59.520\n know it's bad, and they started to make changes. But the problem is that you can't just start making\n\n00:04:59.520 --\u003e 00:05:05.520\n changes to a complaint that is years old. It's completely unreasonable, and in many cases, against\n\n00:05:05.520 --\u003e 00:05:10.080\n the rules. So now we have to go through this battle to try and stop all these changes being made,\n\n00:05:10.080 --\u003e 00:05:15.840\n and it is again dragging things out. Thankfully, if Billy does amend his original complaint and I\n\n00:05:15.840 --\u003e 00:05:20.720\n have to draft a new defense, it looks like Billy will have to cover my costs in doing so.\n\n00:05:20.720 --\u003e 00:05:25.440\n So if he does keep amending his complaint, he'll be paying legal fees on both sides\n\n00:05:25.440 --\u003e 00:05:30.160\n until it's all resolved. Australia is really good when it comes to compensating costs.\n\n00:05:30.160 --\u003e 00:05:34.560\n If he changes something two years later, and then I have to spend more because of it,\n\n00:05:34.560 --\u003e 00:05:39.200\n the Australian court say that Billy needs to compensate me back for the extra effort.\n\n00:05:39.200 --\u003e 00:05:44.080\n So if Billy does keep messing around, delaying things, he will have to pay a lot of money.\n\n00:05:44.080 --\u003e 00:05:48.400\n But unfortunately for me, it just means I have to keep dealing with this for a lot longer.\n\n00:05:48.400 --\u003e 00:05:51.440\n But for my part, I am definitely ready to rock.\n\n00:05:51.440 --\u003e 00:05:59.120\n Originally the Twin Galaxies lawsuit was set for October, but again, Billy is running and hiding.\n\n00:05:59.120 --\u003e 00:06:05.200\n His lawyers successfully delayed it until November, and then they delayed it again until January.\n\n00:06:05.200 --\u003e 00:06:10.000\n Twin Galaxies wants to go to trial as soon as possible. Who wouldn't want to go to trial\n\n00:06:10.000 --\u003e 00:06:15.760\n against Billy Mitchell? It's the easiest slam dunk of all time. The man is a walking L.\n\n00:06:15.760 --\u003e 00:06:21.040\n Billy has no case, he has no evidence, and he has no witnesses. And funnily enough,\n\n00:06:21.040 --\u003e 00:06:26.080\n Billy's lawyers are blaming me for Billy having no one that's willing to lie on his behalf.\n\n00:06:26.080 --\u003e 00:06:30.640\n Yes, it's my fault that Billy can't get any witnesses to back up his story.\n\n00:06:30.640 --\u003e 00:06:35.840\n Recently, Billy's lawyers filed a motion to disqualify Tash, the lawyer for Twin Galaxies,\n\n00:06:35.840 --\u003e 00:06:41.360\n from the lawsuit. And one of the reasons is because Tash gave me access to depositions.\n\n00:06:41.360 --\u003e 00:06:46.400\n Billy claims his deposition was confidential, and his lawyers have already tried to argue this\n\n00:06:46.400 --\u003e 00:06:51.680\n in a previous motion. Previously they tried to hold Tash in contempt for providing depositions,\n\n00:06:51.680 --\u003e 00:06:56.400\n and the judge denied the order. Now they are doing the same thing again,\n\n00:06:56.400 --\u003e 00:07:00.080\n even though the judge has already ruled on this exact matter.\n\n00:07:00.080 --\u003e 00:07:04.080\n First of all, nothing marked confidential was sent to me, and second of all,\n\n00:07:04.080 --\u003e 00:07:09.600\n most of the materials I get don't even come from Tash, it comes from Twin Galaxies.\n\n00:07:09.600 --\u003e 00:07:14.400\n In Billy's recent motion, they claim that Tash sent me depositions for all of these people.\n\n00:07:14.400 --\u003e 00:07:19.200\n However, they are just making things up. Yes, Tash did send me a couple of depositions,\n\n00:07:19.200 --\u003e 00:07:24.080\n but most of the ones I've received didn't come from him. And yet, Billy's lawyers are happy to\n\n00:07:24.080 --\u003e 00:07:29.680\n make up lies with no evidence to try and get Tash disqualified. He claims that Tash continued\n\n00:07:29.680 --\u003e 00:07:34.400\n to send me depositions after he was informed it was a violation of the protective order,\n\n00:07:34.400 --\u003e 00:07:39.600\n but this is patently false. First, the deposition was not confidential, and again,\n\n00:07:39.600 --\u003e 00:07:45.360\n the judge has already ruled on that. And second, Tony's email to Tash was on July 14.\n\n00:07:45.360 --\u003e 00:07:51.520\n The last email me or my lawyers ever received from Tash was July 6, a week earlier. Everything\n\n00:07:51.520 --\u003e 00:07:56.720\n else I've ever gotten came from Twin Galaxies, not their lawyer. They claim that because I talk\n\n00:07:56.720 --\u003e 00:08:02.160\n about depositions in my videos, Billy can't get his friends to sit for deposition. They cite Billy's\n\n00:08:02.160 --\u003e 00:08:07.680\n friend Robert Childs, saying that he is afraid. But here's the thing about Rob Childs. Rob was\n\n00:08:07.680 --\u003e 00:08:13.440\n supposed to be deposed in January at the same time as Billy Mitchell, but just before his deposition,\n\n00:08:13.440 --\u003e 00:08:18.720\n he got a lawyer and avoided it, and has been trying desperately to avoid being asked questions.\n\n00:08:18.720 --\u003e 00:08:24.800\n So he was already unwilling to testify for Billy in January, which is half a year before I made\n\n00:08:24.800 --\u003e 00:08:30.720\n any videos about any depositions. Again, it's just another lie. They also claim that Triforce\n\n00:08:30.720 --\u003e 00:08:36.080\n won't sit for deposition for the same reason. They want us to believe that Triforce, the guy that\n\n00:08:36.080 --\u003e 00:08:41.360\n does public talks defending Billy, the guy that uploads YouTube videos to his own channel\n\n00:08:41.360 --\u003e 00:08:47.040\n defending Billy Mitchell, is afraid to defend Billy in a deposition because it will be uploaded\n\n00:08:47.040 --\u003e 00:08:52.960\n to the internet. This is what I mean when I say Billy's lawyers have an IQ of 60. They cannot grasp\n\n00:08:52.960 --\u003e 00:08:58.960\n simple logic. Obviously, Triforce doesn't care if something is posted online, he does it himself.\n\n00:08:58.960 --\u003e 00:09:04.000\n On Twitter, he even acted as if deposing him wouldn't be a problem. It's only when Billy\n\n00:09:04.000 --\u003e 00:09:10.320\n wants to try to attack twin galaxies that Triforce is now suddenly camera shy. Of course, all of\n\n00:09:10.320 --\u003e 00:09:16.080\n this is irrelevant, however, because all Billy has to do is subpoena Rob Childs or Triforce,\n\n00:09:16.080 --\u003e 00:09:21.760\n and they don't have a choice but to sit down for a deposition. But Billy won't subpoena them,\n\n00:09:21.760 --\u003e 00:09:25.680\n because he knows they won't be able to keep all of their lies straight.\n\n00:09:25.680 --\u003e 00:09:30.720\n Keep in mind, twin galaxies have always been very open about any information they have.\n\n00:09:30.720 --\u003e 00:09:35.840\n They want the public to know as much as possible. Twin galaxies cares about the truth and wants\n\n00:09:35.840 --\u003e 00:09:41.600\n the truth to be known, whatever that truth may be. So, twin galaxies provide any information that\n\n00:09:41.600 --\u003e 00:09:48.000\n it can, and twin galaxies has had no problem getting witnesses to testify, because as it turns out,\n\n00:09:48.000 --\u003e 00:09:53.200\n people are happy to tell their story when they aren't lying. It's only when people have to lie\n\n00:09:53.200 --\u003e 00:09:57.760\n that answering questions becomes difficult. Billy Mitchell is the one that's trying to keep\n\n00:09:57.760 --\u003e 00:10:03.680\n all of this information suppressed. It's Billy Mitchell that is afraid of the truth coming out.\n\n00:10:03.680 --\u003e 00:10:08.000\n Billy's lawyers also lie about communications I've had with twin galaxies.\n\n00:10:08.000 --\u003e 00:10:12.640\n Billy was very upset about getting caught in the lie about the color of the joystick\n\n00:10:12.640 --\u003e 00:10:17.040\n at the mortgage broker's convention. They claim that twin galaxies should have given them the\n\n00:10:17.040 --\u003e 00:10:22.960\n photos beforehand, and that tricking Billy was morally wrong. They take a portion of my video\n\n00:10:22.960 --\u003e 00:10:28.000\n and try to use it as proof that it was all an evil scheme. There are so many logical\n\n00:10:28.000 --\u003e 00:10:32.400\n flaws in here, it's honestly hard to believe, so I'll just wrap it fire through the problems,\n\n00:10:32.400 --\u003e 00:10:37.280\n or we will be here all day. If you need to, you can pause my video to read my script first.\n\n00:10:37.280 --\u003e 00:10:42.080\n They say twin galaxies only sent them two emails from me during discovery,\n\n00:10:42.080 --\u003e 00:10:47.920\n but that's impossible because I knew about the photos. Therefore, this must be a giant cover-up.\n\n00:10:47.920 --\u003e 00:10:53.440\n Oh my god, a six-year-old could debunk this logic. I communicate with Jayce Hall through\n\n00:10:53.440 --\u003e 00:10:59.280\n Signal, which deletes messages after 10 minutes. They seem to forget that email isn't the only\n\n00:10:59.280 --\u003e 00:11:04.240\n form of communication. They quote me as saying I knew about the photos for years, which I have\n\n00:11:04.240 --\u003e 00:11:10.240\n just never said. What are they even quoting? Those two words don't appear in the quoted paragraph,\n\n00:11:10.240 --\u003e 00:11:16.640\n and I've never even said that. I just said I knew the photos existed. I never gave a time frame.\n\n00:11:16.640 --\u003e 00:11:21.440\n They think that because I knew twin galaxies had the photos since 2020, that means twin\n\n00:11:21.440 --\u003e 00:11:28.560\n galaxies must have told me in 2020. This is insanely stupid. Twin galaxies told me,\n\n00:11:28.560 --\u003e 00:11:34.400\n years later, they had the photos since 2020. Billy's lawyers haven't yet discovered the concept\n\n00:11:34.400 --\u003e 00:11:39.840\n of talking about past events. I knew about the photos beforehand, but that doesn't mean I knew\n\n00:11:39.840 --\u003e 00:11:46.320\n because of twin galaxies either. Those photos have been in the public domain since 2011.\n\n00:11:46.320 --\u003e 00:11:52.240\n Multiple people outside of twin galaxies independently had seen the photos, but truthfully,\n\n00:11:52.240 --\u003e 00:11:58.320\n I saw the photos for the first time after Billy's deposition. Before that, I only knew that photos\n\n00:11:58.320 --\u003e 00:12:04.640\n showing a red joystick existed. I hadn't seen them myself, which is why in my video, I say I knew\n\n00:12:04.640 --\u003e 00:12:10.000\n about them, not that I had them or had seen them. They say that I said twin galaxies planned to\n\n00:12:10.000 --\u003e 00:12:14.880\n withhold the photos so they could lay a trap. And apparently, I can only know this because twin\n\n00:12:14.880 --\u003e 00:12:20.800\n galaxies told me. But twin galaxies didn't tell me that, it's just obvious from the deposition.\n\n00:12:20.800 --\u003e 00:12:26.000\n Anyone with more than two brain cells who watches that deposition knows the questions they asked,\n\n00:12:26.000 --\u003e 00:12:32.240\n only makes sense if they assumed Billy didn't have the photos. Obviously, twin galaxies didn't\n\n00:12:32.240 --\u003e 00:12:37.120\n give Billy the photos. When I made my YouTube video, I was just typing it up to make it more\n\n00:12:37.120 --\u003e 00:12:43.520\n interesting. And besides, this trap only works if Billy is a compulsive liar, which he just happens\n\n00:12:43.520 --\u003e 00:12:49.440\n to be. Tony Elrod claims he asked for the photos as part of Discovery and refers to requests for\n\n00:12:49.440 --\u003e 00:12:55.280\n production 36. This was asking for any documents supporting allegations made by twin galaxies in\n\n00:12:55.280 --\u003e 00:13:01.840\n paragraph 25 of the cross complaint. That paragraph talks about a live performance on July 14.\n\n00:13:01.840 --\u003e 00:13:07.920\n However, the photos were actually taken on July 13. So they aren't even on the same day,\n\n00:13:07.920 --\u003e 00:13:13.600\n therefore they are not evidence Billy even played on July 14. And couldn't support that claim in\n\n00:13:13.600 --\u003e 00:13:19.760\n any way. All those photos show is Billy standing in front of a Donkey Kong machine the day prior.\n\n00:13:19.760 --\u003e 00:13:24.000\n They don't confirm he played it, they don't even confirm that it was the machining question.\n\n00:13:24.000 --\u003e 00:13:29.840\n It is impossible to determine if that machine relates to his July 14 score. In his lawsuit,\n\n00:13:29.840 --\u003e 00:13:35.360\n Billy claims he played on an unmodified machine. So based on what Billy had previously said,\n\n00:13:35.360 --\u003e 00:13:40.160\n as far as twin galaxies knew, that machine couldn't have been the one he played on,\n\n00:13:40.160 --\u003e 00:13:45.760\n because that machine was modified. It wasn't until Billy confirmed himself that it was the machine\n\n00:13:45.760 --\u003e 00:13:51.120\n he used that the photos became relevant. But do you want to know what the best part of the\n\n00:13:51.120 --\u003e 00:13:58.480\n red joystick saga is? Billy did actually know the photos existed, and he even already had them\n\n00:13:58.480 --\u003e 00:14:04.800\n himself. Now I know what you're thinking. How the fuck is it possible that Billy had the photos\n\n00:14:04.800 --\u003e 00:14:09.760\n and still lied about the color of the stick and fell for the trap? Well my friend,\n\n00:14:09.760 --\u003e 00:14:14.240\n there are just some things us mortal men can simply never grasp or comprehend.\n\n00:14:14.240 --\u003e 00:14:21.200\n All we can try to do is know the facts. In 2018, Billy called David race and said the convention had\n\n00:14:21.200 --\u003e 00:14:50.560\n photos. Here's a clip from that phone call. Then in August,\n\n00:14:50.560 --\u003e 00:14:57.120\n 2022, five months before his deposition, Billy subpoenaed the convention and got the photos. So\n\n00:14:57.120 --\u003e 00:15:02.960\n Billy already had them. And still in his deposition, not only did he say he didn't have photos.\n\n00:15:15.520 --\u003e 00:15:34.880\n But he still said the stick was black. There are multiple levels of stupidity running\n\n00:15:34.880 --\u003e 00:15:40.640\n concurrently here. And you know what's interesting? When Tash asked Billy if he had photos and Billy\n\n00:15:40.640 --\u003e 00:15:46.720\n said no, who was sitting right next to Billy? Billy's lawyer, Tony Elrod. So Tony was happy to\n\n00:15:46.720 --\u003e 00:15:51.360\n sit there and listen to his client lie and was happy to keep the fact that he had the photos a\n\n00:15:51.360 --\u003e 00:15:57.600\n secret, but when Twin Galaxes traps a compulsive liar, now that becomes a problem. Tony Elrod\n\n00:15:57.600 --\u003e 00:16:02.640\n complains about Tash for various things, like messaging Billy's witnesses trying to get them to\n\n00:16:02.640 --\u003e 00:16:09.360\n send evidence or testify, or showing emotion in his email correspondence. But he himself has done\n\n00:16:09.360 --\u003e 00:16:15.360\n far worse. Tony lied directly to a witness about what Billy Mitchell had said in his deposition,\n\n00:16:15.360 --\u003e 00:16:19.840\n in order to try and coerce the witness into changing their testimony, because what the\n\n00:16:19.840 --\u003e 00:16:25.440\n witness was saying was so damaging to Billy's case. Elrod is happy to send over fabricated\n\n00:16:25.440 --\u003e 00:16:31.360\n evidence and lie on behalf of his client, and when exposed, simply say that it's all a conspiracy\n\n00:16:31.360 --\u003e 00:16:36.720\n theory. Billy's lawyers are going after Tash because Tash is good, and they know they will be\n\n00:16:36.720 --\u003e 00:16:42.320\n destroyed at trial. Billy and his lawyer Tony Elrod are cowards doing everything they can,\n\n00:16:42.320 --\u003e 00:16:47.440\n trying to prevent this entire pathetic lawsuit from being shown to a jury. Everyone knows they\n\n00:16:47.440 --\u003e 00:16:53.600\n will lose, including them, and they are desperate. And I really hope Tony Elrod improves his\n\n00:16:53.600 --\u003e 00:16:58.800\n comprehension skills and gets his facts straight before talking about me again in his frivolous\n\n00:16:58.800 --\u003e 00:17:03.440\n lawsuit. I will let you know when any further updates happen. Thank you so much for watching\n\n00:17:03.440 --\u003e 00:17:11.040\n you legends. I hope you're having a fantastic day, and I will see you in the next video.\n\n",
